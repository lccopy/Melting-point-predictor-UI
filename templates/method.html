                        Predicting molecular melting points is crucial for the characterization and application of chemical compounds. This study presents a machine learning approach utilizing a LightGBM regression model to predict melting
                        points from structural molecular data. We performed an exhaustive data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance. Our findings demonstrate the model's
                        effectiveness in predicting melting points with an acceptable error margin, indicating the potential of machine learning in supplementing experimental thermodynamics.

                    <p>
                        The melting point of a molecule is a fundamental physical property with implications to its chemical stability and application. Traditional experimental methods for determining melting points are often
                        time-consuming and costly. Machine learning models offer a fast, cost-effective alternative for predicting physical properties from molecular structures. This study aims to employ the LightGBM model, renowned for its
                        efficiency with large datasets and high-dimensional features, to estimate melting points of molecules from their chemical properties.

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">2.1 Bibliography:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies have led to the development of new models for predicting the properties of molecules. One challenge, which is still of great importance today, is the prediction of the melting temperature of chemical compounds.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Many teams have tried to overcome this challenge, and the papers below are just a few examples:

                    <p>
                      In our case, the project was carried out independently, and we are not affiliated with any laboratory or organization.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">2.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing:</h3>
                    <p>
                      A dataset of molecular structures and associated melting points was gathered
                      (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1031637" target="_blank">Jean-Claude Bradley Melting Point Dataset</a>).
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h3>
                    <p>We utilized Pearson correlation coefficients to visualize relationships between features, excluding those with coefficients greater than 0.90 to prevent multicollinearity from skewing the model's results.</p>

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">2.4 Feature Engineering:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Various stages of features engineering were carried out, mainly using the RDKit library where possible. As a result, the following columns were added to the initial dataframe:
                      -> Type and number of bonds in each molecules (example: C-C or C=0)
                      -> Functional groups
                      -> Molecular weight
                      -> Number of different elements
                      -> Number of aromatic rings
                      -> Main chain lenght
                      -> Number of double bonds
                      -> XlogP
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">2.5 Feature Scaling:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Numerical features were scaled using an ensemble of scalers to normalize data and reduce the influence of outlier values. The scaled dataset was partitioned into a 90% training set and a 10% test set, balancing the
                        need for model training and validation accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">2.6 Model Selection and Tuning:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The LightGBM model was selected for its advantages in handling large datasets with high efficiency. A pipeline incorporating robust scaling, standard scaling and minmax normalizer was employed, ensuring that scaling
                        would fit on the training data and could be applied consistently to the test data. The model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned using GridSearchCV, optimizing for minimal RMSE.

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">3.1 Model Performance:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Post hyperparameter optimization, the LightGBM model achieved RMSE scores of 40.9°C and 39.5°C on two different test runs, indicating consistent predictive capabilities. Our linear regression baseline started at
                        45°C. The model's performance was further visualized in a scatter plot of actual versus predicted melting points, with deviations from the y=x line analyzed to understand prediction discrepancies. The best neural network model scored at RMSE = 43. We then decided to go on with
                        classical machine learning.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h6 fw-bold">3.2 Error Analysis:</h3>
                    <p>The errors were further examined by creating bins based on actual melting points and calculating statistics within these bins, revealing patterns in the model's performance across different temperature ranges.</p>

                    <p>
                        The LightGBM model exhibited promising predictive performance, but there was evidence of heteroscedasticity in the residuals, indicating the need for potential improvements in model structure or feature engineering. The error
                        analysis revealed specific temperature ranges with higher predictive errors, guiding future research towards targeted model improvement in these areas.

                    <p>
                        The study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting molecular melting points, with LightGBM providing a solid framework for development. While the current model performs adequately, further
                        research into feature enhancement and model refinement is recommended to address areas of high predictive uncertainty. Our approach sets the stage for more sophisticated predictive tools in computational chemistry,
                        aiding in the rapid assessment of molecular properties.
